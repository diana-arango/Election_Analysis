# Colorado Election Analysis
Python Module

## Overview:
In module 3, we learnt how to use Python to support Tom and Seth from the Colorado Board in tabulating their election results for US congressional seat. To complete the audit, it was required to:
Obtain the total number of votes cast
Create a list of candidates and their votes
Find the total number of votes, with the votes that each candidate received
Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won
Determine the winner of the election based on their assigned votes

Moreover, it is expected to determine the voter turnout for each county where the votes were cast, the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county and the county with the highest turnout. All by using for loops and conditional statements with membership and logical operators to find the requested results


## Election – Audit results:

Following is the code used to audit the Colorado congressinal election

Following are the results obtained after reviewing Colorado congressional election

### Election – Audit results:
The python script created for this audit can be used to tabulate and examine any election from any different state. Where not only votes and candidates get iterated. It can also be determined what ballot ID’s pertain to each county or the candidate and county dictionaries and lists can be adjust by reading a different csv file with shorter or longer data information
