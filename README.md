# Colorado Election Analysis
Python Module

## Overview:
In module 3, we learnt how to use Python to support Tom and Seth from the Colorado Board in tabulating their election results for US congressional seat. To complete the audit, it was required to:
Obtain the total number of votes cast
Create a list of the candidates who received the votes
Find the total number of votes, ach candidate received
Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won
Determine the winner of the election based on their assigned votes

### Election – Audit results:

Following are the results obtained after reviewing Colorado congressional election

1.	Total votes cast: 369,711



	
2.	Number of votes and percentage of total votes for each county
a.	County Votes:
Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
Denver:82.8% (306,055)
Arapahoe: 6.7%(24,801)

3.	County with the largest number votes
a.	Largest County Turnout: Denver

4.	Number of votes and percentage of the total votes per candidate

### Election – Audit results:
The python script created for this audit can be used to tabulate and examine any election from any different state where the votes data and candidate’s information will variate. Variables as what candidate obtain the lower number of votes and county where less votes were can be also included on an audit. A challenge for this audit was to first determine the syntax error to save the county votes to a text file and get the final results printed into the election_analysis.txt as shown below. Unfortunately, the election_results file was not found
